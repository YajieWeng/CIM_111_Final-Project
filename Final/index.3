		<section class="introduction">
			By the time kubarra arrived in Barcelona, the old cathedral stadium seemed to have run out of room for the enthusiastic fans, so a new stadium was on the agenda. Since the proposal was put into effect on September 24, 1957, the nou camp has had a hard time, but the dream has finally come true.
Barca had proposed a new stadium as early as 1948. When Hungarian superstar johan khubarra joined barca in June 1950, the cathedral stadium built in 1922 was too small. September 19, 1950. Barca's board of directors, chaired by Mr Garrobert, bought a plot of land near martenstadt, close to the cathedral stadium. On February 9, 1951, the new stadium committee decided to change the address of the new stadium. On 14 November 1953 Francisco miro sanchez was elected President of barca and a strong supporter of the new stadium. On March 28, 1954, in front of 60,000 barca fans, mirossos, accompanied by the municipal President gronna, laid the first stone for the new stadium at the nou camp and was blessed by the Barcelona cardinal modrago.
